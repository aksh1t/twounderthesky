    <tr><th>Or should I say lockdown birthday girl? Every time your birthday comes around, it seems like there is a new lockdown in place and all the birthday plans get ruined. Anyways, I hope we will have fun with the apartment folks on your birthday and still make it memorable despite the lockdown!</th></tr>
    <tr><th><br></th></tr>
    <tr><th>I wanted to write this message as a web page because I wanted to give you a reason to start travel blogging! If you haven't noticed, the address of this website is twounderthesky.com! I wanted to gift you this domain so that you have no reason to push travel blogging any more. I hope you liked the gift-wrapped QR code inside a matchbox, and the kaliedoscope xD. In addition to this, I will also help you setup a very simple blog site which you can post to with the least friction.</th></tr>
    <tr><th><br></th></tr>
    <tr><th>Anyway, I don't want to keep this message very long, instead here's a random poem for you :P</th></tr>

    <tr><th><br></th></tr>
    <tr><th>Happy happy happy birthday to you girl!</th></tr>
    <tr><th>Hope you keep smiling like in the photo girl!</th></tr>
    <tr><th>We have a lot of sunrises and sunsets to share girl!</th></tr>
    <tr><th>May you keep travelling (with me) like the weird crazy person that you are girl!</th></tr>
    <tr><th></th></tr>
    <tr><th>(Well this is not a poem, but I guess if I end everything with girl, it rhymes)</th></tr>
