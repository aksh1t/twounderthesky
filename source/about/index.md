We (Kesha & Akshat) are a crazy couple who love to travel! Most of our travel includes exploring offbeat places where you can just be in the lap of nature's serenity and beauty.

Currently, we are based out of Bangalore and both of us work in the IT industry. This gives us the flexibility to travel at our own pace.

This blog is our way to try and remember the journeys that we make and share our learnings. In addition to travel, we might also write about other random topics which come to our mind!

### About Kesha!

I am this crazy weird person who loves to go to random hills, rivers, lakes, beaches (basically any quiet natural location) and climb trees I see along the way. If I come across a waterfall, I have to jump and take a dip! Trespassing through beautiful landscapes and not getting caught is my secret superpower (that's why I love India!)

Since I was young, my parents took me to a lot of places. From the start, I have always loved the feeling of being surrounded by nature! Being close to nature refreshes my soul and makes me more humble. 

I enjoy going to solo trips where I can be in nature, meet random people, learn about different cultures and of course explore local food! Hiking is one of my passions. I have gone to large number of treks in South India and few in the Himalayas.

Beach, sound of waves and a good book is my favorite place to be!

### About Akshat!

I've always been this very curious person at heart, and nothing piques my curiosity more than the wonders that nature has to offer. I love to learn about birds, animals, insects and trees as much as I can. Not surprisingly, I'm a huge fan of nature documentaries and an even bigger fan of going out in nature myself!

Flying has been a childhood dream of mine, and I have started my journey to become a paragliding pilot - I hope to continue down this path and spend more and more time flying with the birds. The feeling of freedom and calm that you experience when floating beetween clouds in a glider is indescribable. In my opinion, this is something that everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime.

When outdoors, I like activities such as climbing, bouldering and hiking. I also love experimenting with my camera and take all sorts of random pictures.
