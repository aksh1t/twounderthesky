We (Kesha & Akshat) are a crazy couple who love to travel! We like to go and explore offbeat places which showcase nature's serenity and beauty. We are currently based out of Bangalore and both of us work as Software Engineers in remote friendly companies! This allows us to take longer trips and still work at the same time. Aah... remote work, such an exciting concept!!

This blog is our way to try and remember the journeys that we make, and share our learnings along the way. In addition to travel, we might also write about other random topics which come to our mind!
